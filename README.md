# ☕ Bean & Bloom — Instagram Poster Design (4:5)

This repository contains my First design project, created for a café brand concept called Bean & Bloom.  
I designed two Instagram 4:5 posters one static and one animated — using Canva.

These posters are shaped specifically for Instagram feed posts (1080 × 1350).
